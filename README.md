### Hi there 👋

I am Aritro, and I am a CSE grad from VIT, Vellore. I am a product designer and iOS Developer. I sometimes post my work on 📷 [instagram](https://www.instagram.com/not.a.coder), and ofc, here. I tweet about stuff on my 🐦 [twitter](https://twitter.com/aritrotwt), and you can find some of my work on 👨🏻‍💻 [here](https://aritro.work). Sometimes I do web stuff too.

In my free time, I work on a host of 🤞🏻 side projects, some culminating into good stuff, while others land in the graveyard. If (hopefully) the pandemic ceases a little, I'll be doing a master's in HCI at the 🏛 University of Maryland, College Park.
